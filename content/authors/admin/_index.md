I am an biostatistician with a particular focus on statistical methods for public health and medicine. I am interested in causal inference and general effect estimation for observational data. Being active in several medical research areas has enabled me to gain a thorough understanding of a range of statistical and methodological concepts.I am currently working with several colleagues in .... I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), as my primary programming language and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create dynamic documents. This static website is created using R package, [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).

I consider myself to be an extrovert but I love solo travel for the opportunity to just be alone and observe the new place I'm in. I strongly believe that travelling alone is the most liberating thing you could ever possibly do. My profile picture was taken in the most colourful town in the world, [Guatapé](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) , Colombia.

I believe in knowledge sharing, and I try to contribute by sharing my code, notes and.

Now to a very relevant question: **What is the purpose of this site?**

-   To make this space a gathering place for my observations and learnings in the area of statistics and R programming.
-   To write about things that inspire me and keep me curious, outside the context of my professional life.
