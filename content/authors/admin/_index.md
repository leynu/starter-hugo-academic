I am statistician, mother and solo traveller. The priority shifts depending on which week it is, but the strength of my commitment stays enduring. I enjoy working with *Real World Data (RWD)*, which are observational data obtained outside the context of *Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)*. To work with RWD is like unwrapping a present you received from your child, you know what to expect, but you never know what you will find in the end.

My interest includes epidemiology in public health, but my analytical skills are suitable to other fields, such as education, economics, business, or engineering. I use [R](https://www.r-project.org/), as my primary programming language and [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to create dynamic documents. This static website is created using R package, [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/).  

Now to a very relevant question: **What is the purpose of this blog?**

  - To make this space a gathering place for my observations and learnings in the area of statistics and R programming. 
  - To write about things that inspire me and keep me curious, outside the context of my professional life.
